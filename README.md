# cloudgeeks-anydesk-connect

Anydesk Remote Support for Cloud Geeks. This project provides a sleek web page that guides customers through downloading AnyDesk and sending their remote ID to support.

## Usage

1. Open `index.html` in any web browser and share the page with customers.
2. Ask the customer to follow the steps: download AnyDesk, locate their ID as shown, and send it using the built‑in email button.
3. Adjust the support email by editing the `SUPPORT_EMAIL` constant at the top of `index.html`.

The page auto‑detects the visitor's operating system, includes a screenshot for clarity, and reminds customers not to share their ID with untrusted parties.
